  <p>I'm a software developer and photographer based in San Luis Obispo. My resume is below.</p>
  <p>Statement on Generative AI: While useful, I belive that generative AI is fundamentally incompatible 
    with the best practices for effective learning, and as such, no content on this site, whether it be software, writing, 
    or other art forms, was produced using generative AI. Seriously. Go check out my long winded blog post 
    on why I beleive this.
